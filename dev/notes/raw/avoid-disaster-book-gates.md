###### Notes from the book

Human activity produces around 52 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases every year. This is how much "CO<sup>2</sup> equivalents" are added to the atmosphere.

We need to get to zero, but not by the way of depriving people around the world from access to energy. The solution should be to make clean energy so cheap that all countries will choose it over fossil fuels.

During the pandemic in 2020 the emissions only dropped by around 5%. Considering the economic slowdown that it caused, this is suprising how little impact COVID has on emissions.

The reason for this is that fossil fuels are so prevalent in everything we use and do that we might not eve see it. As an analogy Gates cites a speech from D F Wallace about fish and water.

Gates gives a few examples:
- toothbroush made of plastic which is made of pertoleum
- cereals grown using feltilizer that releases GHG when produced
- harvested with a tractor that uses an IC engine
- tractor is made of steel that reuires fossil fuels to be produced
- we wear cotton (fertilized, harvested) or polysters (made of etylene, derived from petroleum)
- EVs run on electricity but it may be made from coal or natural gas
- cars a nd even bikes are made of steel and plastic
- houses are made of cement or timber, both require energy and fossil fuels
- last but not least, everything is transported on vehicles mostly powered by IC engines

The world uses 4 billion gallons of oil per day (100 million barrels, 1 barrel is 42 gallons). There are a few reasons for that, starting with the price - oil is a very cheap source of energy. It is easy to obtain, because there is a big drilling industry that takes care of that. It is also easy to move around since it's a liquid. The price for the damage that comes from burning these fuels is not priced in.

When it comes to energy usage, it's not just the rich world. Economies of the developing countries (like China, India, Nigeria) are growing and so are their energy needs. Population is also set to increase in those countries, with a predicted total of 10B by the end of the 21st century. It is not moral or pracitical to expect these people to consume less energy. What we need to is to find a way to produce more energry that is also cleaner.

Historically, energy transitions took a long time. Through most of history, people used the power of their muscles. Fossil fuels did not become dominant source of energy unilt 1890s in the West and the 1960s in China. Typically from their intrduction to mass market it takes several decades. Typically one source replaces another because it is cheaper and/or more efficient.

In case of renewables, we have different reason to switch - the environmental one - and we need to make sure it happens faster.
