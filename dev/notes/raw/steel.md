# Steel

![Steel Production](assets/steel-header.jpg)

At the very basic level, steel is produced from iron ore metled at temperatures above <span class="value">1500&deg;C / 2600&deg;F</span>. The final product is composed on ~98% iron and 2% carbon.

### Primary steelmaking - Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) 

BOF is a method where iron ore, is smetled into **pig iron** that is later transformed into steel. This process occurs when oxygen is blown through the molten iron ore, initiating an **oxidation** process that reduces the carbon content of the alloy (mixture). The intense chemical reactions expel carbon and other impurities, which either escape as gas or form a slag that can be removed, purifying the metal. 

The result is **steel** - an iron-based alloy with a significantly lower carbon content than pig iron, which is both more durable and more versatile for commercial applications.

BOF is primarely used in large scale production.

### Secondary steelmaking - Electric Arc Furnace (EAF)

EAF is an alternative steelmaking method that primarily utilizes recycled scrap metal as its base material, melting it down using high-voltage electric arcs from graphite electrodes. Unlike methods that rely on iron ore above, the EAF process uses electricity to generate intense heat, melting the scrap and facilitating the production of various steel grades. This approach, crucial for steel recycling, is more energy-efficient and flexible than traditional methods, with its environmental impact heavily influenced by the electricity source.

EAF is more adaptable to small scale production.

Regardless of the method used, the resulting steel is then cast into **inglots** (large blocks) or using a process of continous casting producing so called **blooms** (square bar). Those can be later transformed into finished proiduction by the process of **rolling**, that is squeezing the steel by passing it through a gap between rolls. It can also be **forged/hammered** which is the more traditional method.

### Types of steel

- **Carbon steel** - most basic kind of steel where the main alloying element is carbon (0.3% to %1). Used for cars, pipes, springs.
- **Tool steel** - high carbon steel treated for superior hardness. Ideal for making tools.
- **Alloy steel** - steel mixed with specific element, it has high strength & durability, temperature resilience, and resistance to corrosion. Used for example in jet engines.
- **Stainless steel** - alloyed with chromium it is flavorless, easy to clean and rust resistant. Mostyle used for kitchenware & appliances.

## History

Steel production has ancient roots, with the earliest evidence of steel-making found at [Kaman-Kalehöyük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaman-Kaleh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk), Turkey, dating back as far as 1800 BC. 

For centuries, steel was produced using a labor-intensive process called bloomery, where iron ore was heated with charcoal under low oxygen conditions to produce a spongy mass, or 'bloom,' of iron mixed with impurities. The introduction of the blast furnace in the 15th century, which used higher temperatures to produce a greater yield of higher quality iron, marked a significant advancement. 

In 1856, [Henry Bessemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Bessemer) pioneered the concept of air oxidation in steelmaking, but the process had its limitations. In 1940s [Robert Durrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Durrer) and the team at Voestalpine AG improved on it and developed the [LD process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_oxygen_steelmaking). It is using oxygen instead of air for purer, more controlled steel production. Named after Linz and Donawitz, the first industrial sites of its application, the LD process revolutionized steelmaking, setting the foundation for the modern BOF method.

EAF was first patented in 1889 by [Paul Héroult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_H%C3%A9roult). EAFs operate by applying electric arcs to melt scrap steel or direct reduced iron, as opposed to primarily raw materials like in the case of BOF. The EAF method is integral to steel recycling, supporting a more environmentally sustainable model of steel production by significantly reducing CO2 emissions compared to conventional methods.

## Production numbers

The global yearly production is roughly **1.8-1.9 Billion Tons** (1800-1900 Mt). 

About 25-30% is made using EAF, the remaining 70-75% is produced using BOF. The US is the leader in EAF - it accounts for 70% of the steel production vs only 30% BOF.

Top steel producing countries is China, followed by India, EU, Japan and the US. Largerst producers are, by millions of tonnes produced/year:

- Baowu Group - China - 131.84 Mt
- ArcelorMittal - Luxemburg - 68.89 Mt
- Ansteel Group - China - 55.65 Mt
- Nippon Steel Corporation - Japan - 44.37 Mt

Top producer in US, ranked 16th worldwide, has the largest fleet of EAFs in the world:

- Nucor Corporation - US - 20.60 Mt

## Energy usage

Steel making is an energy intensive process. One ton of steel produced with BOF requires about 20 GJ (GigaJoules) / 5.5 kWh of energy. EAF uses slightly less: 4-7 GJ / 1.1-1.9 kWh. The energy required to produce a ton of steel varies based on the process used, the specific technology at each plant, and the type of steel being produced. The majority of the energy is used for heating processes, but some of it is also used for machinery operations, lighting and transport.

## Carbon Emissions

According to [IEA](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/industry/steel#tracking) the CO2 intensity of steel production is **1.4t of CO2** per 1t of steel. [World Steel Association](https://www.recyclingtoday.com/news/worldsteel-co2-report) put this number slighty higher at **1.85t**.

There is a significant difference in the processes, with BOF averaging 1.987t of CO2 and EAF only 0.357t, which makes EAF much cleaner.

The total CO2 emissions of the steel industryare over **3500 Mt** of CO2 emissions account for **8-11%** of global emissions.

There are multiple steps in steel production that emit CO2. The chemial processes occuring when iron ore is smelted (ironmaking) is responsible for most of the emissions. CO2 is also emitted during the production of to the heat necessary to melt the iron. CO2 can also be emitted when producing the electricity to power the EAFs, if a coal or gas turbine are used.
