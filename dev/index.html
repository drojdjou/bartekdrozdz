        <h1>Hello! My name is Bartek.</h1>

        <p>I am an interactive designer and developer. I live in Los Angeles and I was born in Warsaw, Poland.</p>

        <p>With over 20 years of experience in the interactive design, I've had the privilege of working with clients from all over the world, including major ad agencies, Google, Tesla, Disney and <a href="https://holotype.co/work">many other major brands</a>. My projects have been recognized with prestigious awards, including an <a href="https://holotype.co/project/cuba">Emmy</a>, <a href="https://holotype.co/project/rome">Cannes Lions</a> and <a href="https://thefwa.com/">FWAs</a>.</p>

        <p>My work has been featured in esteemed publications such as the New York Times, Advertising Age, Fast Company, Creativity Magazine, Forbes, and Fortune.</p>

        <p>In 2016, I co-founded <a href="https://kuula.co">Kuula</a>, a software startup providing virtual tour solutions. Starting from scratch, we've grown to serve over 400,000 users. Today, Kuula is widely adopted all around the world in industries such as real estate, architectural design, and beyond.</p>

        <p>I bring a diverse range of skills to the table. From interactive design, front-end and back-end programming to cloud computing, I thrive in the intersection of technology and creativity. This blend of technical expertise and artistic vision allows me to craft immersive and captivating digital experiences.</p>

        <p>While I continue to lead Kuula, expand our product and grow our team, I'm also driven by a deep interest in leveraging software to address environmental challenges.</p>

        <p>I'm focusing on expanding my knowledge about green energy, exploring challenges related to solar, wind, and nuclear power generation. I am also interested in energy storage solutions and how smart grids can help efficient utilization of renewable energy. Last but not least, I have a keen interest in sustainable urbanism.</p>

        <p>My approach to the challenges of climate and energy aligns closely with the principles of <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/manifesto/manifesto-english">Ecomodernism</a>. I believe that by embracing technological progress and innovation, we can achieve a sustainable and prosperous future.</p>

        <p>I'm actively exploring opportunities to invest in climate solutions and startups. By supporting and partnering with forward-thinking ventures, I aim to contribute to the development and implementation of impactful solutions for a sustainable world.</p>

        <p>On my less serious side, I am a semi-professional fl√¢neur with a pretty good knowledge of many cities around the world. I also enjoy snowboarding in the great mountains of western US, spending summers exploring the Mediterranean. Along the way, I love to discover great music and interesting podcasts.</p>
