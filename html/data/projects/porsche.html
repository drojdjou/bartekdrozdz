<h4>Together with the team in Fi we developed a site that revolves around the experience of engine sound in different Porsche models.</h4>

<p>This projects marks an important milestone for me. First of all we received a “FWA Site of the day” award for it. For Fi it was the 25th overall, but for me  it’s the first for a project that I worked on.</p>

<p>I also happened to be my first AS3 project ever - with many more to come in the upcoming years. Good old times!</p>
