<h4>In 2010, I have been working with North Kingdom on an interactive installation called Woodbot Pilots.</h4>

<p>It’s located at the Skellefteå Airport in Northern Sweden. If you happen to be in the area, make sure to check it out. However, as I imagine, it isn’t a location easily accessible to most of my readers, so I will be posting more pictures &amp; videos as they appear.</p>

<p>Woodbot Pilots is a gestures controlled racing game. We display it on a huge 82″ HD touch screen (191 x 123 cm!) and we used a special 3D depth camera is used to read the gestures. The camera was developed by a company called Fotonic and is somehow similar to Microsoft Kinect but has a bigger range (up to 7m) and is optimized for industrial environments.</p>

<p>The talented artists from Ars Thanea and North Kingdom created beautiful visuals and the sound engineers from Dinamhoe added a great soundtrack. The game itself was developed in the Unity3D engine. We connected the 3D camera using a C/C++ plugin developed by programmers over at Interactive Institute in Umeå who did a fantastic job – it runs very smoothly.</p>

<p>The game logic is implemented in C# – quite some code in there, even though the game concept is relatively simple. Thanks to a powerful graphic card (XFX Radeon HD 5870 1GB GDDR5) the thing runs at 60 FPS in full HD resolution which is quite amazing!</p>
