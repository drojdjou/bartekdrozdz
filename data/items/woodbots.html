<h4>In 2010, I was working with North Kingdom on an interactive installation called Woodbot Pilots.</h4>

<p>Woodbot Pilots was a gesture controlled racing game running on a huge 82″ HD touch screen (191 x 123 cm!). We used a special 3D depth camera to read the gestures. This was before anybody knew what Kinect was! The camera was developed by a company called Fotonic. It had a range up to 7m/21ft, optimized for industrial environments.</p>

<p>The installation was deployed at the Skellefteå Airport in Northern Sweden in the main departures area.</p>

<p>The talented artists from Ars Thanea and North Kingdom created beautiful visuals and Dinamhoe added a great soundtrack. The game itself was developed with Unity3D. We connected the 3D camera using a C/C++ plugin developed by Interactive Institute in Umeå who did a fantastic job – it did run very smoothly.</p>
