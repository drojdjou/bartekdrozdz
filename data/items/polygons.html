	<h4>If you have LeapMotion laying around, it's a good moment to connect it and give it a try!</h4>

	<p>If you don't have it, you can still move the polygons around using your mouse or finger on a touch device, but it's not half as fun! :)</p>

	<p><em>Technology:</em> Canvas, Leap Motion JS API</p>

	<div class="canvas warning">You need a browser that supports the canvas element to run this experiment. <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>, Safari or IE 9 and up will do.</div>
