<h4>Tool's latest HTML5 experience, developed in house with its own custom framework, showcases over 200 award winning live action and digital content projects in a fluid CSS 3D environment.</h4> 

<p>"The renewed site of Tool is a site with an excellent, clean, minimalist design, exceptionally well-done from a technical point of view." - <i>Awwards Judging Team</i></p>

<p>"In an age where so many agencies have succumbed to a one page scrolling site to showcase their portfolio, it is a delight to see such an original agency website for Tool. There is an obvious amount of love and care seen in each section of the site, with super-slick transitions at all times. Attention to detail is everywhere and the portfolio of work is oustanding and displayed in full effect. This site will inspire many other agencies." - <i>Rob Ford, FWA Founder</i></p>
